  <h2><span class="highlight">Design Histories for DfE</span></h2>
  <p>I wrote a number of Design Histories while working on projects in the Department for Education. Some are for internal use only, but you can find my posts for DfE Connect in the <a href="https://design-histories.education.gov.uk/team/school-account">School Account Team section</a>.</p>
  <p>Design Histories are essentially blog posts for projects, detailing important updates and decisions made. They proved to be extremely useful. You can read more about them in <a href="https://dfedigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/09/01/design-history/">this DfE blog post</a>.</p>
