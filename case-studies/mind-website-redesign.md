        <p>Mind’s website plays a vital role in providing mental health support and encouraging donations. They commissioned a migration to a new version of Umbraco — a technical update, yes, but also an opportunity. The brief was to keep what worked, rework what didn’t, and improve the experience for users and internal teams alike.</p>

        <p>I led the UI and interaction design for the project.</p>
    </div>

    <h2><span class="highlight">Understanding the boundaries</span></h2>

    <p>There were known constraints from the outset: a fixed budget, a set timeframe, and no budget or structure in place for direct access to end users. Research conducted by earlier agencies offered some broad insights, but not the depth we’d usually want — especially for a service that supports people in vulnerable states.</p>
    <p>We kicked off with a stakeholder success definition workshop. With multiple teams involved across Mind, we knew the project would only run smoothly if we created alignment — both between internal teams and between Mind and us. It turned out to be an insightful and genuinely enjoyable session.</p>
    <p>Mind had hoped we’d be able to create detailed user journeys from the existing research. But there simply wasn’t enough to do that responsibly — not without getting ‘creative’ with the gaps, which isn’t something I do.</p>
    <p>So instead, we mapped all the information we had on a whiteboard, looked for links and relationships, and developed what we called an experience map.</p>
    <p>The map visualised how different types of users encountered Mind’s services, how this related to business goals, and where improvements could be made. We created it by combining existing research, introducing insights from the success definition workshop, and mapping out known pathways, pain points, and common entry routes into support content, information pages, and donation flows.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>After I refined the visual into something more digestible, I shared it back with the team. They immediately dubbed it the “Mind Network Map” — and were genuinely enthusiastic about using it across the project.</p>
    <p>Alongside the map, I also developed a set of persona behaviour flows — lightweight, plausible pathways that reflected different user types and their likely goals. These helped fill the gap left by the incomplete research and allowed us to design with specificity, without fabricating detail. They worked well in guiding both content priorities and design decisions.</p>

    <p>Next, I worked closely with a user research colleague to engage Mind’s internal teams in a series of co-design workshops. Their day-to-day proximity to user challenges made them a valuable proxy. We used the core content model and service journey mapping techniques to work with them on defining user needs and success criteria across key parts of the site.</p>

    <h2><span class="highlight">Designing the donation journey</span></h2>

    <p>The donation flow was a clear priority. Mind needed it to perform better — not so much through persuasion, but through clarity. People wanted to donate, but the path was confusing.</p>
    <p>I began by mapping the existing journey, identifying friction points such as duplicate CTAs, unclear gift options, and disjointed transitions. From there, I prototyped a streamlined flow: fewer steps, clearer microcopy, and a visual design that reduced noise. Cognitive load was a key consideration. The redesigned interface introduced clear hierarchy, persuasive and supportive copy, focused calls to action, and reassuring progress indicators.</p>
    <p>The result was measurable. With a new Google Analytics setup in place, we tracked a 70% increase in online donations post-launch, compared to the 12-month baseline prior to redesign.</p>

    <h2><span class="highlight">Structuring support content</span></h2>

    <p>Alongside the donation journey, I led the redesign of Mind’s information pages — a critical part of the site often accessed by people in distress. The content had to be findable, easy to absorb, and presented with care.</p>
    <p>The previous site was visually cluttered — too many competing elements and messages on a single page. Given Mind’s mission to bring clarity and support to people in crisis, I focused on stripping back the noise. Working with a content designer and the teams at Mind, I developed modular templates with strong typographic hierarchy, clear visual signposting, and consistent page structures. We designed for scannability and accessibility — prioritising what users needed to know first, and removing distractions that might overwhelm.</p>
    <p>e also addressed long-standing readability issues. The existing font choices made it harder for many users to engage with the content — particularly on mobile. I gave the team guidance on selecting clear, accessible typefaces, and the marketing team chose a new font set for the redesign.</p>
    <p>The templates also gave internal teams more control, reducing reliance on bespoke layouts while maintaining consistency across the site.</p>

    <h2><span class="highlight">Co-design in context</span></h2>

    <p>The co-design sessions helped shape both the donation and information design work. Internal teams brought a grounded view of what users struggle with — but also surfaced issues we hadn’t expected. In one session, we discovered staff regularly struggled to find their own resources on the site, prompting us to think more inclusively about navigation and internal search.</p>
    <p>Throughout, I created and refined the prototypes that supported this work — iterating based on feedback, presenting back to stakeholders, and ensuring all proposed components met accessibility requirements. That included everything from contrast ratios and heading structure to interaction patterns and focus states.</p>

    <h2><span class="highlight">Building the right thing, the right way</span></h2>

    <p>Once designs were agreed, I liaised directly with the development team to ensure they were implemented as intended. There were a few issues with the initial build — not unusual for a project of this scope — but I worked closely with the developers to flag and resolve those quickly. By launch, everything had been built to spec.</p>

    <h2><span class="highlight">Reflections</span></h2>

    <p>This wasn’t a full rebrand or a blank slate. It was a focused, practical redesign with real constraints — and that’s what made it interesting.</p>
    <p>We improved the clarity of information for people seeking support. We made it easier for people to donate, and they did. We brought consistency to a large and complex site without overengineering it. And we did it all while staying within Mind’s existing brand — extending it thoughtfully, not reinventing it.</p>
    <p>I’m proud of the donation flow redesign and the measurable uplift it achieved. But I’m just as proud of the smaller details — the page templates that now better support real people, the design decisions made with care, and the collaboration that made it possible.</p>
    <p>It’s a good reminder that even within brand and platform constraints, considered interaction design can lead to real-world impact — when done with focus, clarity, and empathy.</p>

    <h2><span class="highlight">Highlights</span></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>70% increase in online donations following redesign</li>
        <li>Modular, accessible templates created for core information content</li>
        <li>UI and interaction design delivered under tight budget and research constraints.</li>
        <li>Strategic use of experience mapping and behaviour flows to guide decisions</li>
        <li>Excellent long term relationship developed with Mind</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since the redesign Mind have gone through a brand redevelopment with branding agency DesignStudio. They kept the logo but changed fonts, and developed the colour palette and messaging. <span class="visually-hidden">(opens in new tab) </span><a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Take a look at the site now</a>.</p>
