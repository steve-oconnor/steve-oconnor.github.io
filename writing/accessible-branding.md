  <div class="intro-wrapper">
    <p>We talk a lot about accessibility in design — rightly so. But when it comes to branding, there’s a tendency to stop at the basics: contrast, legibility, maybe a screen-reader pass or two.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>The truth is, an accessible brand isn’t just one that passes technical checks. It’s one that invites more people in, across all touchpoints. That includes how it looks, sounds, feels — and how it treats the people who use it.</p>

  <p>Here are a few ways we try to go beyond compliance in our branding work. They’re not radical ideas, and they’re definitely not exhaustive. But they’re a start.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">1. Let people choose how they consume content</span></h2>
  <p>Some of us read. Some prefer to listen. Others want to watch, skip, or skim.</p>
  <p>Providing more than one way to access your content helps people find what works for them. BBC News does this well — their stories come in written, audio, and video formats. Spotify has added automatic podcast transcripts, which help people who are deaf or hard of hearing (and also those of us trying to find that one quote we half-remembered on a walk).</p>

  <p>The point is: one format rarely fits all.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">2. Make your brand recognisable, even when it’s blurry</span></h2>
  <p>People don’t always experience your brand in crisp, full-colour conditions. That’s worth keeping in mind.</p>
  <p>Consistent, simple, recognisable elements — colour, shape, layout — help everyone, especially those with low vision or processing difficulties. McDonald’s is a good example: their golden arches are visible from a distance, from a moving car, even through rain-splattered glass. Apple’s minimal design language works in a similar way — clean, deliberate, recognisable across devices.</p>

  <p>Not every brand needs to shout, but it should be recognisable when whispered.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">3. Reduce the mental effort needed to understand what you mean</span></h2>
  <p>Clear, direct language isn’t just a UX principle — it’s a brand value.</p>
  <p>Avoiding jargon, writing in plain English, and structuring content simply all make life easier for people with cognitive disabilities, ADHD, or anyone reading while distracted, tired, or stressed (i.e. most people at some point).</p>

  <p>GOV.UK’s content style is often referenced — and for good reason. It’s designed to be understood quickly, by people in a hurry, dealing with real-world situations. That's a decent design brief for most services, frankly.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">4. Speak in a way that includes, not excludes</span></h2>
  <p>The language your brand uses sends signals — often unintentional ones.</p>
  <p>Using gender-neutral terms, avoiding ableist phrases, and being mindful of tone all help make sure you're not excluding people who should feel welcome. For instance, saying “go through the process” rather than “walk through” is a small shift — but if you’ve ever been left out by a metaphor, you’ll know it adds up.</p>

  <p>Microsoft does this well. Their writing guidelines are updated regularly to reflect inclusive language. They don't get it right every time — no one does — but they’re making the effort visible.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">5. Make everything accessible — not just the website</span></h2>
  <p>Your brand isn’t just your homepage. It’s the tweet with a graphic. The event banner. The email footer. The packaging.</p>
  <p>Social platforms like Instagram and X (Twitter) support alt text — and many brands now use it meaningfully, not just mechanically. Mailchimp offers email templates with accessibility baked in. LEGO has even produced braille versions of its instructions.</p>

  <p>The message? If it’s branded, it should be inclusive. Not just the bits that get audited.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">6. Don’t forget your video and audio content</span></h2>
  <p>Videos are brilliant for engaging people — but without captions, transcripts, or audio descriptions, you’re leaving a chunk of your audience behind.</p>
  <p>Netflix captions almost everything. TED Talks offer transcripts. YouTube lets you add custom subtitles. These features aren’t fancy extras — they’re how people follow along.</p>

  <p>If your brand relies on video, the least you can do is make sure people can understand what’s going on, with or without sound or sight.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">7. Ask actual people</span></h2>
  <p>There’s no checklist that beats talking to real users.</p>
  <p>Testing with disabled people — not just personas or assumptions — is the most effective way to find out what’s working and what isn’t. Google does this regularly. It’s one of the reasons features like screen readers, voice control, and adjustable fonts are standard on Android.</p>

  <p>It’s not about being perfect. It’s about designing with, not just for.</p>

  <h2><span class="highlight">Final thoughts</span></h2>
  <p>Accessibility isn’t a one-off fix, and it’s not about heroism. It’s about listening. Adjusting. Making things a little bit easier for someone who might otherwise be shut out.</p>
  <p>If you care about how your brand shows up in the world, accessibility can’t just live in the footer or the legal checklist. It has to be part of how you speak, how you show up, and how you think.</p>

  <p>And when you do that — when accessibility becomes part of the brand itself — everything gets better.</p>

  <p>For everyone.</p>
