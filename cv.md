  <h1>Steve O’Connor CV</h1>
  <div class="intro-wrapper">
    <p>I design digital services that make life easier for the people who use them — especially when those services are complex or need to meet accessibility standards. Over the years, I’ve worked on everything from donation journeys to internal government platforms, usually as part of a cross-functional team.</p>
    <p>I’m comfortable leading projects from early research through to delivery, and I care about doing the job properly — from getting the details right in a prototype to helping colleagues grow their skills.</p>
    <p>Most recently, I’ve been focused on creating an inclusive design system to ensure projects start with a high level of accessibility built in, and on developing internal tools for a pharma client without losing sight of users’ needs.</p>
